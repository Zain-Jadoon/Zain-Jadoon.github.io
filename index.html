			<h2 class ="sub-heading">My Skills & Experience</h2>
			<p class="center">I am interested in many topics in tech, but here are the main umbrella topics that I like to focus on and enjoy the most.</p>

			<div class="row hor-ver-center">
				<div class="col-4">
					<ion-icon name="code-outline"></ion-icon>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>I have experience in many programming languages such as: python, go, javascript, and C; but I am most experienced and comfortable with Python. I have experience with both object oriented and functional programming paradigms.Currently I have not published most of my projects since they are of smaller scale, but I am looking into making new projects of larger scale.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
					<p>I am quite experienced with GNU/Linux and technologies surrounding it, I can confidently: navigate and manage the filesystem, create and format hard drive partitions, configure networking. I am quite familiar with GNU utilities such as: sed, awk, and grep. I have previously used Arch and Gentoo Linux, but currently I use Void Linux.
					</p>

					<ion-icon name="git-branch-outline"></ion-icon>
					<h3>Algorithims<h3>
					<p>I have reached a point in my journey of programming where I think that I have enough knowledge to handle Algorithms and Datastructures. Currently I do not know many common algorithms but I have started to look into DataStructures such as: Hash Maps, Trees, Linked Lists, Graphs, and many more. I have had a little bit of experience with sorting algorithms but I want to continue learning more in this Field.

			<div class="about-me-text ">
				<p class="about-me-paragraph">I am a 15 year old kid with a fiery passion for computers in areas such as computer science, Gnu/Linux, programming and upcoming digital technologies and solutions. I have interests in almost all areas in computer science and programming technologies but currently I want to further my web development skills.Iâ€™m based in New Jersey, in the United States of America, where I primarily spend my free time learning about these topics mostly because I have great interest in them but also so that I can be prepared when I one day decide to enter the industry.</p>			
				<br>
				<p class="about-me-paragraph">I was always inclined to learn to program and further my skills. As a five year old I was introduced to the hour of code challenge and I was instantly hooked and had shown success. As I got older I had transitioned to learning more about code with the Khan Academy coding course which allowed me to learn the fundamentals to eventually take the leap to start learning python and eventually making projects and learning more and more programming languages which eventually gets us today where I am still on a constant mission to learn more and more about programming. </p>			
				<br>
				<p class="about-me-paragraph third">The purpose of this website is still not entirely known to me but for now I think that it will serve as a good personal portfolio website and a place where I can put anything that I want to, and am not at the mercy of any centralized tech corporation. I built this site to practice design since I had never focused my efforts in that area and it has become a testament to my skill in this regard.</p>
