			<h2 class ="sub-heading">My Skills & Experience</h2>
			<p class="center">I am interested in many topics in tech, but here are the main umbrella topics that I like to focus on and enjoy the most.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4">
					<ion-icon name="code-outline"></ion-icon>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>I have experience in many programming languages such as: python, go, javascript, and C; but I am most experienced and comfortable with Python. I have experience with both object oriented and functional programming paradigms.Currently I have not published most of my projects since they are of smaller scale, but I am looking into making new projects of larger scale.
					</p>

					<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
					<p>I am quite experienced with GNU/Linux and technologies surrounding it, I can confidently: navigate and manage the filesystem, create and format hard drive partitions, configure networking. I am quite familiar with GNU utilities such as: sed, awk, and grep. I have previously used Arch and Gentoo Linux, but currently I use Void Linux.
					</p>

					<h3>Algorithims<h3>
					<p>I have reached a point in my journey of programming where I think that I have enough knowledge to handle Algorithms and Datastructures. Currently I do not know many common algorithms but I have started to look into DataStructures such as: Hash Maps, Trees, Linked Lists, Graphs, and many more. I have had a little bit of experience with sorting algorithms but I want to continue learning more in this Field.
